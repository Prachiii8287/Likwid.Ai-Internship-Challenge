# Likwid.Ai-Internship-Challenge
Full Stack Intern Challenge: ERP Module for Manufacturing


ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement 1:
As part of Likwid.Aiâ€™s ERP platform for manufacturing companies, you're tasked with building a Customer Management Module that allows users to:

Upload a list of customers via an Excel sheet.

Detect and avoid duplicate entries (optionally update if already exists).

Display a dashboard of top 10 customers:
- By geography
- By sales volume
- By most purchased product


ðŸ”„ Suggested Workflow
Fork the base repo.
Create feature branches: customer-upload, dashboard, etc.
Push code with clean commits.
Submit via repo link or PR.

Tech Stack -
Backend - Python
Frontend - React, JS, HTML

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement 2:
Google Sheets Sync â€” Continuous API Integration

Extend the Customer Management Module by creating a continuous integration with Google Sheets API, where:

Any new customer added/updated in the system is also reflected in a connected Google Sheet.

Any changes made in that Google Sheet (e.g. edits to customer name, phone, or sales) are automatically synced back to the backend.

This should be bidirectional, and duplicate handling should still apply.
